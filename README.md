# Interactive Form V1
Full stack JavaScript Techdegree project 4

JavaScript validated with JSHint

HTML and CSS validated with W3C validator

Checked for cross browser compatibility with Firefox, Chrome, Edge, and IE 11

**Notes:** 
After reading several articles about prototypal inheritance and the module pattern, I opted for a module pattern that does not use any constructor functions.  I feel like it is cleaner and easier to follow this way.

I had to change the font size for the x and o on the win screen to rem instead of em for cross-browser compatibility with IE11.

Also, recursive algorithms make my brain hurt!
